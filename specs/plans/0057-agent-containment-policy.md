# Implementation plan: Agent containment policy

- **ID:** RFC-0057
- **Delivery status:** In progress; first OpenShell hardening slice authored, runtime proof pending
- **Owner:** OpenClaw Enterprise maintainers
- **Authority:** [RFC-0057](../rfcs/0057-agent-containment-policy.md) and the [platform design](../../docs/design.md)
- **Source baseline:** `main` at `55da37a9d`

## Outcome and scope

An authorized deployment of a dedicated Kubernetes Agent on an Installation requiring containment admits an exact Namespace-owned `SandboxPolicy`, freezes it in the AgentRevision, and activates only after the selected Sandbox Driver proves enforcement before the Harness executes. Embedded and SSH execution remain outside the first supported scope. The RFC owns the proposed contract and open design choices.

## Contract and source touchpoints

The Agent deployment path owns policy reference authorization, admission, and immutable revision contents. The worker rechecks authorization and selected Driver identity. The `SandboxDriver` owns provider-specific translation and evidence; the Kubernetes Compute Driver owns workload identity, baseline isolation, and lifecycle ordering. Start from the current [Sandbox Driver contract](../../docs/reference/drivers/sandbox.md), [Agent lifecycle](../../docs/reference/agents.md), and [OpenShell flow](../../docs/flows/openshell-sandbox-provisioning.md).

## Implementation

1. **OpenShell hardening slice:** Require `hard_requirement` Landlock compatibility in the bundled Driver, reject weaker or unknown Installation settings at startup, and check the serialized `CreateSandbox` request through the existing integration path. This is authored separately in [PR #919](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-enterprise/pull/919), which can be reviewed independently of this RFC. It does not claim a new platform policy or qualified production deployment.
2. Add the Namespace policy resource, exact IAM and audit operations, API schema, PostgreSQL constraints, Agent reference, and immutable AgentRevision snapshot. Extend the regular Agent deployment integration test for exact authorization, scope, snapshot immutability, and refusal without a capable selected Driver.
3. Extend the provider-neutral `SandboxDriver` contract with admission and enforcement evidence. Wire the API, work queue, worker, Compute, and Driver through the real Agent workflow. Keep provider-specific translation in the Driver. Prove rejection, pending enforcement, activation, replacement, and cleanup; a test-only Driver is insufficient for a production containment claim.
4. Qualify a pinned OpenShell release for projected identity, Secret references, workspace mounts, authenticated transport, and pre-execution policy ordering. Extend the disposable Kubernetes OpenShell integration with a real model turn and allowed and denied child actions. Prove both conflicting network cases: Kubernetes allows while the provider denies, and the provider allows while Kubernetes denies. Traffic must fail in both cases and must never exceed the admitted policy. Unsupported upstream combinations remain unavailable.
5. If host isolation is selected, qualify gVisor or Kata RuntimeClass separately through the Compute-owned Kubernetes path, including scheduling, storage, networking, and denial behavior.

Each behavior-changing step updates its owning reference, guide, source-backed flow, and integration coverage. The API cheat sheet is generated from the owning API contract.

## Open decisions

OCE maintainers must settle the smallest provider-neutral policy vocabulary and evidence for pre-execution enforcement before steps 2 and 3 can ship. The first supported scope is dedicated Kubernetes execution; expanding required containment to embedded or SSH Agents needs separately qualified paths.

## Delivery record

The OpenShell hardening slice changes [the bundled adapter](../../apps/controller/src/drivers/sandbox/openshell.ts), [its integration test](../../tests/integration/sandbox-driver-startup.test.mjs), [the current reference](../../docs/reference/drivers/openshell-sandbox.md), and [the flow](../../docs/flows/openshell-sandbox-provisioning.md). Runtime qualification remains pending. The `SandboxPolicy` resource, immutable revision snapshot, and enforcement evidence are not implemented.

[PR #919](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-enterprise/pull/919) carries the independent Driver hardening. After explicitly preparing frozen-lockfile dependencies, all 19 startup integration cases passed locally on #919 head `599776430`; workspace, lint, type, formatting, and documentation checks also passed. This establishes Installation composition, rejection of weaker settings, and Driver request construction, not live kernel enforcement. [Pinned provider diagnostics](https://gist.github.com/gauravprasadgp/3a3206219f7fad1153590385e999cfab) show runtime qualification refusing startup on the local Docker VM because Landlock syscalls return `ENOSYS`. They do not prove successful filesystem enforcement, the changed OCE request path, or refusal before an Agent-owned child executes. Full runtime proof and maintainer acceptance remain outstanding. Docker is running and the pinned images are available; a compatible kernel, k3d, and disposable cluster fixtures remain required.
